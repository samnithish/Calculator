This HTML document represents a simple calculator web application. It begins with standard HTML structure, including metadata and links to external CSS and icon files. The calculator is contained within a form element with the name "calci."

Inside the form, there's an input field with the class "value" that is initially set to read-only, serving as the display for the calculator's input and output. Below the input field, there are various buttons, each with an associated function defined in the "onclick" attribute.

- "AC" clears the input field.
- The backspace button deletes the last character.
- Buttons with numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and a decimal point allow users to input mathematical expressions.
- The "=" button calculates the result using the JavaScript "eval" function and displays it in the input field.

The calculator utilizes JavaScript to perform these operations dynamically. Users can click the buttons to input values and operators, and the result is displayed when they click the "=" button. This simple calculator provides basic arithmetic functionality in a user-friendly web interface.
